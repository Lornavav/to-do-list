# To-Do-List

To do list is a basic application that can be used to create a list of tasks that you need to get done. It offers users the ability to type in tasks they need to complete. The applicaton will then populate a list for the user. The user can delete task that are no longer required. The user can strikethrough completed tasks.

    * Colour Scheme

    I took the inspiration for a gradiant backgorund scheme from [Web Dev Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5tuwAO-_Kg). I just played around with some hex codes from there and came up with this scheme.

    * Typography 

    I wanted the font to look like handwriting so that it would like a traditional style list. Like one you would create with a pen and paper. Using google fonts I discovered Nanum Pen Script.
