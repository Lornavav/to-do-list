# To-Do-List

To do list is a basic application that can be used to create a list of tasks that you need to get done. It offers users the ability to type in tasks they need to complete. The applicaton will then populate a list for the user. The user can delete task that are no longer required. The user can strikethrough completed tasks.

## Application Goals

The goal of this application is to offer users a way of managing their tasks on a daily basis. 

## User Stories

 * As a user I want to see the current date displayed when i visit the to do application.
 * As a user I want to be able to input a to do item into the input field and click on the add button.
 * As a user after I have input a to do item and clicked 'add' I want to see my to do item populate in a list below the input field.
 * As a user I want to be able to press the 'Enter' key on keyboard to add my to do item to the list.
 * As a user if i click 'add' without entering a to item into the input field I want to see an alert message.
 * As a user when I have completed a to do item I want to click it and see a line through it.
 * As a user when I click the 'x' on a to item I want the item to be removed from the screen.

    * Colour Scheme

    I took the inspiration for a gradiant backgorund scheme from [Web Dev Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5tuwAO-_Kg). I just played around with some hex codes from there and came up with this scheme.

    * Typography 

    I wanted the font to look like handwriting so that it would like a traditional style list. Like one you would create with a pen and paper. Using google fonts I discovered Nanum Pen Script.
